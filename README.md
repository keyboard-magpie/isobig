The big brother of isoPad

Designed to use either one or two Kailh Bigswitches, with an in-development giant 3d printed stabiliser or "POS" style keycap.

It can use either a pro-micro compatible controller, or a blackpill controller, with standard QMK `handwired/onekey` firmwares.

There are places for LEDs and lots of breakout for experiments.

PCB files are in PCB folder, Case/Keycap files are in Mechanical folder.
